    "### The state representation\n",
    "In SeaPearl, the state $s_t$ is defined as a pair $s_t = (P_t, x_t)$, with $P_t$ a partially solved combinatorial optimization problem and $x_t$ a variable selected at time $t$ of an episode. A terminal episode is reached if all variables are fixed or if a failure is detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The action space\n",
    "Given a state $s_t = (P_t, x_t)$, an action $a_t$ represents the selection of a value $v$ for the variable $x_t$. The action space is defined as the set of all possible values for the variable $x_t$ at time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The transition function\n",
    "Given a state $s_t = (P_t, x_t)$ and an action $a_t = v$, the transition function is comprised of three steps;\n",
    "1. The value of variable $x_{267}$ is assigned as $v$ (i.e., $D(x_{t+1}) = v$).\n",
    "2. The fix-point operation is applied on $P_t$ to prune the domains (i.e., $P_{t+1} = \\text{{fixPoint}}(P_t)$).\n",
    "3. The next variable to branch on is selected (i.e., $x_{t+1} = \\text{{nextVariable}}(P_{t+1})$).\n",
    "This results in a new state $s_{t+1} = (P_{t+1}, x_{t+1})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The reward function\n",
    "SeaPearl uses a \"propagation-based reward\". As the goal of the agent is to quickly find a good solution, it needs to learn to effectively prune the search space and move toward promising regions. An intuitive way to configure the reward is to give the agent the objective value, but this information is only available at the end of episodes. In other words, it makes the reward signal extremely sparse. To address this problem, SeaPearl uses both an intermediate reward and a final reward. The intuition behind the intermediate reward is this: it is computed by rewarding the pruning of high values from the variable's domain and penalizing the pruning of low values from the variable's domain. Mathematcially, the intermediate reward is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "r_t^{ub} = \\{ v \\in D_t(x_{\\text{{obj}}}) \\mid v \\notin D_{t+1}(x_{\\text{{obj}}}) \\land v > \\max(D_t(x_{\\text{{obj}}})) \\} \\\\\n",
    "r_t^{lb} = \\{ v \\in D_t(x_{\\text{{obj}}}) \\mid v \\notin D_{t+1}(x_{\\text{{obj}}}) \\land v < \\min(D_t(x_{\\text{{obj}}})) \\} \\\\\n",
    "r^{mid}_t = \\frac{{r_t^{ub} - r_t^{lb}}}{{\\lvert D_1(x_{\\text{{obj}}}) \\rvert}} \\\\\n",
    "r^{end}_t = \\begin{cases} -1 & \\text{{if unfeasible solution found}} \\\\ 0 & \\text{{otherwise}} \\end{cases} \\\\\n",

    "Next up, we need to define the neural network that will learn the value selection function. As the problems can differ in size, the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) is particularly appropriate. GNNs are a class of neural networks that operate on graphs, which means we need to convert the problem instances to graphs. In SeaPearl, we use tripartite graphs, which are graphs with three types of nodes: variables, values and constraints. There is one node for every variable, for every value and for every constraint. The edges are defined as follows:\n",
